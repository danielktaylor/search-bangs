# Firefox Search Bangs

This is a Firefox extension to add support for DuckDuckGo-style search bangs.

Examples:

* `!tw Elon Musk` ⮕ Search Twitter for "Elon Musk"
* `!gm New York` ⮕ Search Google Maps for "New York"
* `!a Harry Potter` ⮕ Search Amazon for "Harry Potter"

## Why?

The *easiest* way to use search bangs is to set your search engine to DuckDuckGo!

But there are a few reasons you might want to use this extension, instead:

* You use a different search engine, like Google
* You've tried similar Firefox extensions and found them to be missing key features:
     - Don't support standalone bangs (e.g. `!w`)
     - Don't support bangs that aren't at the beginning of the search (e.g. `New York !gm`)
     - Etc...

## Found a bug?

Any behavioral differences from the way DuckDuckGo works are considered bugs.
